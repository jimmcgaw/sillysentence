# Silly Sentence Application

When I was in college, we used to play a game where one group of people would randomly generate
silly, nonsensical subjects for sentences and the other group would generate predicates. I took this game
a few years later, as one of my first ASP.NET apps with MS SQL. Later I ported it to Django with MySQL.

All of that was overkill for this simple application. I've never used Flask, so here is a Flask-based
implementation with React.js driving the front-end. The backend is nothing more than a couple of static
files that contained pickle'd Python lists of the subjects and predicates people contributed.

Super low-tech backend. I'm interested in testing its performance.

## To run me

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

``` $ npm install ```

annnnnnnnnnndddd:

``` $ python app.py ```
